### Luca does a caltech advanced c++ lab assignment

given the header file mbrot.h i need to implement it in mbrot.cpp and then implement the buddhabrot


The assignment is split into 3 parts lets see how far i get


### Usage

First make the file

```ps
make
```
then run the program, all inputs are intergers

```ps
./buddha.exe image_size number_of_points depth_of_search
```

number of points should be around 1000000 for a clear image depth should be around 100 both can be lowered to make it run faster
